2 projects I did to earn my AI Internship Certificate.

There are two ipynb files in this repository, each file is for a separate project, no 2 are connected to the other one.



The first one is the Auto Correct Tool

The second one is the Translator App - this was a relatively simple project, all I had to do was import the 'translate' module.
